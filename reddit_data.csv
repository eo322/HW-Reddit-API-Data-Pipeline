Some interesting take-aways:

* GPT-3 demonstrates that a language model trained on enough data can solve NLP tasks that it has never seen. That is, GPT-3 studies the model as a general solution for many downstream jobs **without fine-tuning**.
* It would take **355 years** to train GPT-3 on a Tesla V100, the fastest GPU on the market.
